    Computes the wavefunctions psi_{nk}(r) of the unit cell unfolded on the supercell real space grid, from the planewave coefficients of the unit cell.

    Inputs:
        C_ngk: (nband, nkpt, nG_max) array of complex
            Planewave coefficients of the wavefunctions of the unit cell.
        nG: (nkpt, ) array of ints
            Number of active G vectors for eack kpoint of the unit cell.
        G_red: (nkpt, nG_max, 3) array of ints
            Reciprocal lattice vectors of the unit cell in reduced coordinates, written in the signed integer FFT convention.
        k_red: (nkpt, 3) array of floats
            k-points of the unit cell in reduced coordinates
        Omega_sc: float
            Volume of the supercell
        Ndiag: tuple of ints
            Supercell scaling volume, e.g. how many times we repeated the unit cell in each direction to construct the supercell
        ngfft: (Nx, Ny, Nz) tuple of ints
            FFT grid shape of the super cell
        bands: list of ints
            Specific band index at which to compute the wavefunctions. Reduces computational load by only considering bands we want to study
